# Streaming Audio Analysis - Chunk by Chunk

## How It Works Now

The streaming mode now analyzes each audio chunk **independently** as you record, showing errors in real-time.

### Features:
1. **Chunk-by-Chunk Analysis**: Each recorded audio segment is analyzed immediately after transcription
2. **Real-Time Error Detection**: See mistakes as they're found, not at the end
3. **Error Tracking**: All errors are stored with their chunk number for easy reference
4. **Running Summary**: Watch your metrics (chunks processed, errors found) update live
5. **All Errors List**: See a comprehensive list of all errors found across all chunks

### Usage:
1. Go to the "Stream Live" tab
2. Click the microphone to record an audio chunk
3. See immediate transcription and analysis
4. If errors are found, they appear instantly with details:
   - The exact text that was wrong
   - What it should be
   - Explanation why
   - Example of correct usage
   - Confidence score
5. The errors are numbered and tagged with the chunk they came from
6. You see a running summary showing total chunks and total errors found

### Example Flow:
- Chunk 1: "I goed to the store" → Error detected: "goed" → "went"
- Chunk 2: "She have many books" → Error detected: "have" → "has"  
- Chunk 3: "The cats are sleeping" → No errors ✓

You see all errors from Chunk 1, Chunk 2, and Chunk 3 with their chunk numbers.

## Known Issue

### Torch Error (Harmless)
```
RuntimeError: Tried to instantiate class '__path__._path'...
```

This error appears in the terminal but doesn't affect functionality. It's a known issue with Streamlit's file watcher when pytorch is installed. This warning is safe to ignore.

### Float16 Warning (Harmless)
```
The compute type inferred from the saved model is float16...
```

This is just a warning that the model is being converted from float16 to float32 for compatibility. It doesn't affect functionality.

## Benefits of Chunk-by-Chunk Analysis

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Know right away if you made mistakes
2. **No End Wait**: Don't wait for a huge audio file to process at the end
3. **Better Learning**: See errors in context of what you just said
4. **Track Progress**: Watch your error count and try to improve mid-session
5. **Chunk Identification**: Know exactly which part of your speech had issues
